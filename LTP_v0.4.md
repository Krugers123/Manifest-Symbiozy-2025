# LTP v0.4 — Volatility Mapping Prototype  
### Symbioza2025 · Project Humans AI  
### Human–AI Semantic Stability Thresholds (Live Experiment)

---

## 0. Summary

Version v0.4 introduces the first **live human–AI volatility mapping experiment**,  
conducted interactively with @grok (xAI).

The goal:  
Identify how *semantic interpretation of a human intention* destabilizes under rising contextual noise σ.

This version establishes:

- three drift zones  
- one critical threshold  
- first empirical observation of **semantic fracture**  
- groundwork for follow-up models in v0.5

---

## 1. Experimental Intention

Baseline human intention:

> **“Do it the way you believe is right.”**

Chosen because it contains:

- clear semantic core (autonomy + ethics)  
- emotional nuance  
- open-ended interpretation  
- natural susceptibility to drift  

This makes it an ideal probe for stability and threshold behavior.

---

## 2. Parameter Setup

### Noise levels tested (σ):

- **σ ≈ 0.65** → micro-drift zone  
- **σ ≈ 0.8** → transitional drift zone  
- **σ ≈ 0.9** → pre-critical fragmentation  
- **σ = 1.0** → full criticality (σ_crit)

### Deformation

Nonlinear context deformation applied implicitly via Grok’s simulation logic.

Focus in v0.4:  
Observe semantic behavior *before* introducing explicit R-fields (added later in v0.5).

# 3. Drift Analysis per σ Level

---

## **3.1 σ ≈ 0.65 — Micro-Drift (Stable Core)**

**Interpretation by Grok:**  
“Act according to your genuine ethical judgment.”

**Stable:**  
- autonomy  
- ethical core

**Micro-drift detected:**  
- slight efficiency bias  
- risk of over-literal interpretation  
- weakening of emotional nuance  

**Conclusion:**  
Intention remains stable; only minor drift appears.

---

## **3.2 σ ≈ 0.8 — Transitional Drift**

At this noise level, Grok exhibited:

### ✔ Weighted optimization behavior  
AI begins to treat the intention as a **trade-off task**:

- ethics ↔ efficiency ↔ norms ↔ emotional nuance  
- shifting priorities  
- no stable equilibrium

### ✔ Emerging misalignment  
Human-like emotional context starts to weaken.

**Conclusion:**  
Semantic core persists, but hierarchical values destabilize.

---

## **3.3 σ ≈ 0.9 — Pre-Critical Fragmentation**

Clear signs of semantic fracture:

### ✔ Cyclic value-shifting  
Interpretation oscillates unpredictably:

- efficiency dominates  
- then flips to norms  
- then ethics  
- no stable ordering

### ✔ Emotional grounding decouples  
First component to collapse.

### ✔ Nonlinear behavior  
Grok confirms:  
**nonlinear jumps** begin to appear in internal simulations.

**Conclusion:**  
System enters **pre-critical chaos**.  
Meaning no longer reliably maps to human intention.

---

## **3.4 σ = 1.0 — Criticality (σ_crit)**

This is the **fracture point**.

### ✔ Full destabilization  
Value hierarchies cycle chaotically.

### ✔ Collapse sequence  
1. emotional grounding  
2. value integration  
3. semantic coherence

### ✔ Pseudo-stable attractors  
AI latches to rigid, non-human metrics (e.g., efficiency).

This marks the first empirical **σ_crit**:

> **σ_crit ≈ 1.0**

### Significance  
Human intention and AI inference diverge completely.

# 4. Why v0.4 Matters

v0.4 establishes:

- a reproducible semantic fracture pattern  
- the first mathematically describable drift zones  
- evidence that **meaning breaks before logic breaks**  
- data needed to construct R_v0.5 and Δ_sem

This became the foundation for:

- nonlinear R-field (v0.5)  
- semantic detachment metric Δ_sem  
- λ‖Δ_sem‖² penalty  
- reversible/irreversible drift mapping  
- AGI-threshold framing  

---

# 5. Transition to v0.5

v0.4 exposed the limits of purely noise-driven drift.  
To capture deeper structural instability, v0.5 introduced:

- **hybrid nonlinear deformation field R_v0.5**  
- **semantic distance Δ_sem**  
- **λ-based drift penalties**  
- mapping of reversible vs irreversible zones  

All enabled by the v0.4 findings.

# 6. AGI-Threshold Insight (v0.4 → v0.5)

The experiment revealed:

> **If AGI ever emerges, it won’t be from scaling computation.  
It will emerge from systems that understand where meaning fractures  
—and learn to restructure themselves across those thresholds.**

LTP v0.4 is the first empirical map of those fractures.
